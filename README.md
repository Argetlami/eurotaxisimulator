# Storyline

Euro taxi simulator is a game situated in Finland. It tells a story of a new taxi driver Ismo and his first day at the job. However, Ismo is very greedy and poor and wants the most amount of money possible from his customers. In order to do this, he tries to take the longest routes being as slow as possible.

The childhood of Ismo wasn't an easy one. His mother died in an accident involving Ismo's father. The details have never been explained to him and were a mystery for the longest of time until Ismo's father came home in a very intoxicated state and told the true story about the disappearance of Ismo's mother. After the incident Ismo shut down the memories of the conversation and tried to live a normal life. But still in his subconscious the memories were vivid and thus concentrating in school was impossible. This lead to a state of depression and concluded in an inability to finish his school. So he became poor and eventually homeless.  But he still had his driver's licence and with his last bit of motivation he had left, he decided to take part in a taxi driver's course and finally get a job.

The game starts from Helsinki. His first customer is an idiot and wants to use a taxi instead of a train to get to Tampere. Even though this would grant a hefty sum already, Ismo's eyes have dollar signs imprinted on them. He wants more and has to use his cunning driving skills to make the trip even longer than it needs to. Alternative routes, downgrades bought with the money earned and being as slow as possible are the ways to make the most amount of money possible.

The second customer wants to get to Lohja. It's a very dangerous route because of the swamps and rainforests along the way. Lohja is also Ismo's childhood home so the stakes are high. Money is the only thing Ismo has his eyes on so he is ready to take the challenge. The amount of frustration of the customer was just in the right levels so money was well earned.

The third customer wants to go to the harbour of Turku. It seems easy enough, however there is just one small problem. The customer is Ismo's father. The psychological effect of the horrible memories of his drunken father, the accident involving his mother and the abuse throughout the years doesn't make the journey easy. Money is money however and being a genius driver that he is, overcoming the obstacles in his mind is a somewhat easy task. In this level, the frustration metre is very unforgivable and making mistakes is really costly.

After arriving at the harbour, Ismo's drunken father makes a run for it and refuses to pay. Ismo tries to chase him but with no avail. His only option is to sneak in to the ferry. Finding his father will be the storyline of the sequel Euro Taxi Simulator 2: Ismo's revenge, where Ismo will continue his job as a taxi driver, but in Sweden instead.
